        //when you store float data, you must put "f" or "F" at the end.
        //bcs Java wants to keep accuracy high in decimal data and by default using double data type...

        //Example: Create two float data and print total value on the console...
        float priceOfBook = 13.99F;
        float priceOfCoffee = 15.99f;

        System.out.println("Total Value=>  " + (priceOfBook + priceOfCoffee)); //Total Value=>  29.98
