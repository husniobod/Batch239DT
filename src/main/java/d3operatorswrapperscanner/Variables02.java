/*
                1) Primitives store the value we assign
                Non-Primitives contain methods along with the values...

                2) Primitives start with lowercase; non-primitives start with uppercase

                3) Primitives are created by Java and 8.
                 Non-primitives can be created by developers and no limit for number of them

                4) Primitives use memory based on their types from 8 bit to 64 bit
                Non primitives use memory in different sizes based on their number of members (variables and methods)
